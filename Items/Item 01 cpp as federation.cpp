/*
 * View C++ as a federation of 4 different languages:
 * 
 * 
 * C: Pointers, built-in types, arrays, preprocessor all come from C
 * 
 * Object-Oriented C++: Classes, Polymorhphisim, Inheritance, Virtual functions, dynamic binding, ctors, dtors etc
 * 
 * Template C++: Has some other rules and idioms to be aware of to work correctly. Template Meta Programming
 * 
 * STL: Ways of doing things to be aware of, specificly how Containers, Iterators, Templates and Functors work together.
 * 
 * 
 * Summary: Different rules for effective programming depend on what subset of C++ you are working in. Be aware of that as you work and switch between them.
