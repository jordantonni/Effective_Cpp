/*
 * Be aware of Template Metaprogramming
 * 
 * Code that executes and computes during compilation.
 * 
 * Loops are done via recursion of template instantiation
 *  - Instantiating another version of the template within itself, with different paramter values
 * 
 * 
 * SUMMARY:
 *  - Can shift work from runtime to compile time -> Earlier error detection
